# Run selected / highlighted text in Terminal (VSCode)

I'd like to be able to run commands in the terminal based on what I've highlited in a file in VSCode.

Example:

```bash
ls
```

Or

```bash
date
```

Or

```bash
curl -X GET "https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/programming/random" -H "accept: application/json" | jq
```

## Solution

I can use the `CMD+E` combination to do this, here is the VSCode Keybinding:

```json
{
  "key": "cmd+e",
  "command": "workbench.action.terminal.runSelectedText"
}
```

A windows equivalent would be:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+e",
  "command": "workbench.action.terminal.runSelectedText"
}
```
